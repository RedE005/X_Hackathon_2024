# X_Hackathon_4202024

## Installation

Before running this project, you will need to install the required Python dependencies. This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage its dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This project was built using Python 3.8, but it should be compatible with any Python 3.x version.

It is also recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to avoid conflicts with other packages and manage dependencies more easily. You can create a virtual environment using `venv` or another virtual environment manager of your choice. Here's how you can set up a virtual environment with `venv`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (replace 'env' with the name of your environment)
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is active, you can install all required dependencies by running the following command in the root directory of this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that you have all the necessary software to run the project.

### Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can run the project. (Provide instructions on how to run your project, e.g., executing a script or running a server.)

```bash
# Example command to run the project
python your_script.py
```

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project, please ensure you install the development dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and follow the project's contribution guidelines. (You can elaborate on contribution guidelines or link to a CONTRIBUTING.md file.)
